# Codebase for statistics based on similarity and connectivity. 

To use the functions, all the files in the `relastat` folder need to be in the same directory as the file you are working in.  Then, you can import the functions like this:
This is shown in the `tutorial.ipynb` file. In this documentation it for a function written as: `data_preparation.graph_functions.matrix_from_tables` you would import 
all the functions in that file by writing: `from relastat.data_preparation.graph_functions import *`.  Then you can use the functions by writing `matrix_from_tables()`.

Hopefully this will be a package soon, but for now this is how it works.
